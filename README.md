A beta of the IIT BBSR Tour - using logitech G29

The scene is that of the IIT BBSR Map. The road network is built with reference from the Google Maps view of the campus. Buidlings and other structurs are designed seperately and used here.

The Cars use are from Standard Assets. Its car controller script is used and modified for having realistic control using the Logitech G29 Steering Wheel. Appropriate vehicle physics is also implemented. Basic Force feedback is also implemented. 

The modification are basically in the Input Manager, Car Controller Script. The Car User Controller is scraped and is replaced LGTest.cs

I have used the Logitech SDK for my scripts. 

Note: The Logitech SDK available in the Asset needed a .dll file to be replaced. Also needed to paste an x_input.dll file.
